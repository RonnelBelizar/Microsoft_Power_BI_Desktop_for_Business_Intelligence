### Topics To Go Back

  - 44. Data Source Parameters
    - This has something to do with dealing with switching with development and production projects especially with MySQL project that I am to do soon

### Day 08 — (12/29/25)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - Data modeling
  - Dabase normalization
  - Fact & dimension tables
  - PK & FK
  - Star & snowflake schemas
  - Connecting multiple fact tables

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - Connected tables

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - Connecting a fact table to the dimension tables is new to me since in SQL, fact tables are like 'queries' done when the schemas are defined — which are originally not included in database design like there is an extra layer of queries done in Power BI (which makes sense) vs MySQL for instance.

### Day 04 — (12/22/25)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - Data QA and Profiling tools
  - Text tools
  - Numerical Tools
  - Date & Time Tools

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - Hovering through transformation tools in query editor

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - These are basically Transfrom step from the ETL stuffs I have learned from IBM data Engineering but these are simpler to do since they are UI based
  - I am grateful I have learned ETL and SQL first before all of these as these became easier to understand

- ❓ Open questions:

### Day 02 — (12/20/25)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - Types of data connectors
    - Flat files
    - Connecting thru MySQL
  - Basic table transformations
    - Checking table headers, data types, etc
    - Basics on how to deal with delimiters
  - Web scraping

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - Basic pbix transformations

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - This surprised me because this can also be done in SQL but the process is simpler
  - Having an internal web scraping capability is also great. I did all of this in Python which was harder to do

- ❓ Open questions:
  - How powerful is pbix versus python / SQL?
