# Learning Journal

### Topics To Go Back

  - 44. Data Source Parameters
    - This has something to do with dealing with switching with development and production projects especially with MySQL project that I am to do soon

### Day 14 — (01/04/26)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - DAX
    - SWITCH
    - Common Text Functions
    - Basic Date and Time Functions

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - DAX

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - The context is very similar wwith SQL

- ❓ Open questions:
  -

### Day 12 — (01/02/26)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - DAX
    - Basic Math and Stat Functions
    - Conditional and Logical Functions

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - DAX

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - Fundamental aggregations

- ❓ Open questions:
  -

### Day 11 — (01/01/26)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - DAX
    - DAX vs M-Language
    - Intro to DAX calculated columns
    - DAX Measures
    - Implicit vs Explicit
    - Quick Measures
    - Calculated Columns vs Measures
    - Filter Context
    - Step-by-Step DAX Measure calculation
    - DAX Syntax and Operators
    - Common DAX Function Categories

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - DAX
    - Calculated Columns & Measures

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - This is pretty similar with SQL. This is where back-end computation happens.

- ❓ Open questions:
  - How far should I learn this? How much work should be done in SQL first before deciding how much DAX should be done?

### Day 09 — (12/30/25)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - Filter Context and Filter Flow
  - Bi-Directional Filters and Ambiguity
  - Hiding Fields from Report View
  - Model Layouts
  - Data Formats and Categories
  - Creating Hierarchies

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - Data modeling

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - This is essentially important to learn because this taught me to build an appropriate data models in PowerBI which is needed before I even touch the daat visualization part

- ❓ Open questions:
  - How much of this should be done first in SQL before it touches PowerBI?

### Day 08 — (12/29/25)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - Data modeling
  - Dabase normalization
  - Fact & dimension tables
  - PK & FK
  - Star & snowflake schemas
  - Connecting multiple fact tables

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - Connected tables

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - Connecting a fact table to the dimension tables is new to me since in SQL, fact tables are like 'queries' done when the schemas are defined — which are originally not included in database design like there is an extra layer of queries done in Power BI (which makes sense) vs MySQL for instance.

- ❓ Open questions:
  -

### Day 06 — (12/27/25)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - Appending queries
  - Appending files from a folder
  - data source settings
  - refreshing queries

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - Hovered query editor tools

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - 

- ❓ Open questions:
  - 

---

### Day 05 — (12/26/25)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - Change type with Locale
  - Rolling Calendars
  - Index & Conditional Columns
  - Grouping and Aggregating
  - Pivoting and Unpivoting
  - Merging Queries

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - Hovered query editor tools

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - Same concepts with SQL — makes it easier to understand since I have background

- ❓ Open questions:
  - 

---

### Day 04 — (12/22/25)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - Data QA and Profiling tools
  - Text tools
  - Numerical Tools
  - Date & Time Tools

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - Hovering through transformation tools in query editor

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - These are basically Transfrom step from the ETL stuffs I have learned from IBM data Engineering but these are simpler to do since they are UI based
  - I am grateful I have learned ETL and SQL first before all of these as these became easier to understand

- ❓ Open questions:
  - 

---

### Day 02 — (12/20/25)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - Types of data connectors
    - Flat files
    - Connecting thru MySQL
  - Basic table transformations
    - Checking table headers, data types, etc
    - Basics on how to deal with delimiters
  - Web scraping

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - Basic pbix transformations

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - This surprised me because this can also be done in SQL but the process is simpler
  - Having an internal web scraping capability is also great. I did all of this in Python which was harder to do

- ❓ Open questions:
  - How powerful is pbix versus python / SQL?

---

### Day 01 (Restart) — (12/19/25)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - Continued studying introduction to PowerBI from a long rest

- 💻 What I practiced:
  - Introduction
  - Connecting and loading csv to PowerBI
  - Connecting MySQL to PowerBI

- 💡 Key takeaway:
  - This is extremely valuable to learn because this turns my raw data from my database into actionable insights

- ❓ Open questions:
  - How deep should I learn PowerBI?

---

### Day 01 — (11/28/25)

- 📘 What I studied today:
  - Enrolled to Udemy's Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence

- 💻 What I practiced:
